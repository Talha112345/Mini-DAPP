My dApp Assignment

This project is a simple decentralized application (dApp) for the MG3012 - Blockchain Technology for Business course.

It consists of a Solidity smart contract deployed on the Sepolia testnet and a simple web frontend to interact with it using MetaMask.

Smart Contract

Contract Address: 0xdd7d218977c0dd391B3B4076A0C6221Cca76C1cF

Testnet: Sepolia

Verified Contract Link 

Routescan: https://testnet.routescan.io/address/0xdd7d218977c0dd391B3B4076A0C6221Cca76C1cF

Functions

The contract allows you to:

setMessage(string): Set a new message.

incrementValue(): Add 1 to a counter.

getMessage(): Read the current message.

getValue(): Read the current counter value.

getOwner(): Read the address of the contract deployer.

Frontend

The frontend is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (using the ethers.js library).

How to Run

Deploy (Done): The contract is already deployed at the address above.

Run Frontend: The easiest way to run this is through the live GitHub Pages link:

[PASTE YOUR GITHUB PAGES LINK HERE ONCE IT'S LIVE]

Interact:

Open the link above.

Click "Connect Wallet" and connect your MetaMask wallet (must be on the Sepolia network).

Use the buttons to read data or send transactions to the blockchain.
